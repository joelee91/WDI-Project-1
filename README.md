# WDI-Project-1

# OVERVIEW
    My project 1 is the game snake.
    As the game opens, players are faced with an intro screen with a single button in the center
    with the text "Start Game". Once the user clicks on the button, a new game of snake will begin. 
    The objective and win condition is different from other more traditional snake games, where they
    require the player to fill the whole screen with the length of the snake, my game only requires
    the user to achieve a total snake length of 20 boxes.
